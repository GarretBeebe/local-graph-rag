# local-graph-rag

A local Graph RAG system that builds a knowledge graph over your documents and uses it alongside
vector search to answer both specific and thematic questions.

Runs entirely on local hardware via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) and
[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech). No external API calls required.

> **Status:** Planning phase. See [`context/GRAPH-RAG-PLAN.md`](context/GRAPH-RAG-PLAN.md) for the
> full implementation plan.

## Why Graph RAG?

Standard RAG retrieves isolated text chunks. It answers "find me the passage about X" well, but
struggles with questions that require connecting information across documents:

- *"How does the fingerprint store relate to the watcher?"*
- *"What are the main architectural themes in this codebase?"*
- *"What depends on the embedding module?"*

Graph RAG builds a knowledge graph during ingestion — extracting entities and relationships from
each document — then uses that graph structure at query time to expand context beyond what any
single chunk contains.

---

## Architecture

Two indexes are built during ingestion:

```
Documents
    │
    ▼
[Chunker]
    │
    ├──► [Embedder] ──► Qdrant (dense vectors for semantic search)
    │
    └──► [Entity Extractor] ──► Graph Store (NetworkX + SQLite)
                                      │
                                      ▼
                              [Community Detection]
                                      │
                                      ▼
                              [Community Summaries] ──► SQLite cache
```

At query time, a router classifies the question and picks a retrieval strategy:

| Query type | Example | Retrieval strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **Local** | "What does the fingerprint store do?" | Entity lookup → graph traversal → supporting chunks |
| **Global** | "What are the main themes?" | Community summary search → map-reduce |

Local queries combine vector search (to find seed entities) with graph traversal (to expand
context). Global queries use pre-built community summaries retrieved by embedding similarity.

## Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Vector store | Qdrant |
| Graph store | NetworkX (in-memory) + SQLite (persistence) |
| Community detection | Louvain (`python-louvain`) |
| LLM / embeddings | Ollama |
| Web framework | FastAPI |
| Package manager | uv |

### Tiered model strategy

Three different Ollama models are used for different stages, tuned for the CPU-only K16 hardware:

| Stage | Default model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Entity extraction (`EXTRACT_MODEL`) | `qwen2.5:3b` | Structured JSON only; ~4× faster than 14B |
| Community summarization (`SUMMARIZE_MODEL`) | `qwen2.5:7b` | Needs more synthesis; still 2× faster than 14B |
| Answer generation (`GEN_MODEL`) | `qwen2.5:14b` | Quality matters for the final response |

All three are overridable via environment variables.

## Implementation Phases

- [ ] **Phase 1** — Project skeleton, copied infrastructure, `settings.py`, `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] **Phase 2** — Graph store (`graph/store.py`) + entity extractor (`graph/extractor.py`)
- [ ] **Phase 3** — Full ingestion pipeline with fingerprint-based change detection
- [ ] **Phase 4** — Community detection + summarization
- [ ] **Phase 5** — Local and global retrieval paths + CLI query interface
- [ ] **Phase 6** — FastAPI web server with streaming

## Relation to `rag-system`

This is a **standalone project**. It does not import from `rag-system` as a package dependency.
Five small utility modules are copied and adapted; everything else is built from scratch.

Both systems can run concurrently — they use separate Qdrant collections and separate SQLite
databases.
